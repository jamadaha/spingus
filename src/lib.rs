//! # Spingus
//!
//! _A simple, fast, and robust PDDL parser_
//!
//! **Spingus** has three goals:
//!
//! + *Robust* - Is tested on commenly used PDDL domains and problems
//! + *Fast* - Optimised and benchmarked to be as fast as possible
//! + *Simple* - Avoids rarely used PDDL syntax in favor of easy of use
//!
//! ## Example
//! ```rust
//! use spingus::problem::objects::Object;
//! let input = "(define (problem prob)
//!                   (:objects o1)
//!                   (:init (p o1))
//!                   (:goal (not (p o3)))
//!              )";
//! let problem = spingus::problem::parse(&input);
//! assert_eq!(problem.name, Some("prob"));
//! assert_eq!(problem.domain, None);
//! assert_eq!(problem.objects, Some(vec![Object { name: "o1", type_name: None }]));
//! //...
//! ```
//!
//! ## Benchmark
//! Benchmarked on a i5-13600k with [Criterion](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs)
